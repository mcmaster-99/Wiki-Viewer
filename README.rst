Wiki-Viewer
===========

- Tools used:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. jQuery
5. Bootstrap
6. Git
7. Github

- What the app does:

The Wiki Viewer application is similar to Wiki (who guessed).
It takes the user's search and displays all the hits/results.

- Future updates:

I will definitely be working more on this application in the future
and make it more sophisticated than what it is.
